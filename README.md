# arima-anomaly-detection

In Machine Learning ARIMA model is generally a class of statistical models that give outputs which are linearly dependent on their previous values in the combination of stochastic factors. The ARIMA model works by using a distributed lag model in which algorithms are used to predict the future based on the lagged values. Here I try to use an ARIMA model for Anomaly Detection.
